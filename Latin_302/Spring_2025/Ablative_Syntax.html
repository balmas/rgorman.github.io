        <h1>Ablative Case Semantics</h1>
        
        <h2>Separation & Origin</h2>
        <p>The ablative case frequently expresses separation, referring to the place whence or the concept of origin. These modifiers are typically constructed using <strong>a(b), dē, e(x), sine</strong> + ablative, though prepositions are omitted when referring to towns and small islands—particularly in poetry.</p>
        <p class="example">Eō ex finitimīs populīs turba omnis avidō novārum rērum perfugit.<br/>
            "A whole crowd of people from neighboring tribes, eager for a new life, took refuge." (Livy 1.8.6)</p>
        
        <h2>Distance & Measurement</h2>
        <p>The ablative case can also indicate distance, and in such cases, no preposition is required.</p>
        <p class="example">[Horātius] videt [hostēs] magnīs intervallīs sequentēs.<br/>
            "Horatius saw his enemies follow at great intervals." (Livy 1.25.8)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Agent</h2>
        <p>For animate beings performing an action in the passive voice, the ablative of agent is used with <strong>a(b) + ablative</strong>.</p>
        <p class="example">Volturcius a legatis desertus est.<br/>
            "Volturcius was abandoned by the envoys." (Sall. Cat. 45.4)</p>
        
        <h2>Cause or Reason</h2>
        <p>This construction expresses either a factual reason for an event or an argument given for an action or state.</p>
        <p class="example">Plurimus hic aeger moritur vigilando.<br/>
            "Here many a sick man dies from lack of sleep." (Juv. Sat. 3.232)</p>
        
        <h2>Comparison (Ablative of Comparison)</h2>
        <p>Used without <strong>quam</strong>, this form expresses a "point from which" a comparison is viewed.</p>
        <p class="example">Luce sunt clariora nobis tua consilia omnia!<br/>
            "Clearer than the sunlight are all your plans for us!" (Cic. Cat. 1.6)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Place Where</h2>
        <p>Typically constructed using <strong>in, sub, prō</strong> or without a preposition for towns and small islands.</p>
        <p class="example">Erat Athēnis spatiosa domus, sed infāmis.<br/>
            "Once upon a time, there was in Athens a spacious but infamous house." (Pliny 7.27.5)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Time When/Within Which</h2>
        <p>Usually constructed without a preposition unless emphasizing duration.</p>
        <p class="example">Quid in bellō [possunt]?<br/>
            "What are they capable of in times of war?" (Caes. B.G. 2.4.1)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Means</h2>
        <p>This construction expresses the instrument or tool used to perform an action and is generally without a preposition.</p>
        <p class="example">Tum [Daedalus pennās] līnō mediās et cērīs alligat īmās.<br/>
            "Then Daedalus bound the feathers together in the middle with flaxen thread and at the bottom with wax." (Ovid Met. 8.193)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Accompaniment</h2>
        <p>Formed using <strong>cum + ablative</strong>, indicating "together with" or "nearby."</p>
        <p class="example">Desinant obsidēre cum gladiīs cīvium.<br/>
            "Let them stop besieging the senate building armed with swords." (Cic. Cat. 1.32)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Manner</h2>
        <p>May be constructed with or without <strong>cum + ablative</strong>. The noun may or may not be modified by an attribute.</p>
        <p class="example">Incredibilī celeritāte ad flūmen dēcurrērunt.<br/>
            "They ran down to the river at incredible speed." (Caes. B.G. 2.19.7)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Route</h2>
        <p>Expressed without a preposition when indicating a road, bridge, or path.</p>
        <p class="example">Aureliā Vīā profectus est.<br/>
            "He left by the Aurelian Way." (Cic. Cat. 2.6)</p>
        
        <h2>Ablative of Price</h2>
        <p>Appears without a preposition to express monetary value.</p>
        <p class="example">Emī virginem trīgintā mīnīs.<br/>
            "I bought a young woman for thirty minae." (Plautus Curc. 343–44)</p>
        
        <h2>Descriptive Ablative</h2>
        <p>Acts either as an attribute of a noun or part of the predicate with a copula.</p>
        <p class="example">Catilīna fuit magnā vī et animī et corporis.<br/>
            "Catiline was very strong in mind and body." (Sall. Cat. 5.1)</p>
