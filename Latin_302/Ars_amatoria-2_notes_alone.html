            <h2>Notes</h2>
            
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            
            <p>l. 57: <b>Spectātum</b>. This form of the verb is called a <b>supine</b>. It is the identical to the <b>Perf Part Sing Neut Acc,</b> where the Perf Part exists. It is used as an ADV to express purpose with verbs indicating motion.
                Translate "to observe."</p>
            
            <p>l. 59: <b>Prīmus.</b>   A secondary predication.  The construction is very common with ordinals. Often translated "first to X" where X is the associated verb. </p>
            
            <p>l. 59: <b>sollicitōs</b>. An object complement (OCOMP). The verb <em>facio</em> often takes the frame "make X Y" where X is the direct object and Y is an adjective or noun indicating a change in X. For example, in "you make me tired," <em>me</em> is the direct 
                object and <em>tired</em> the object complement.</p>
            
            <p>l. 62: <b>crocō.</b> An <b>ABL</b> noun can be used to specify or limit an adjective (as an adverbial <b>ADV</b>). Here, for example, "red with saffron."</p>
            
            <p>l. 63: <b>Palātia</b>. The Palatine was the area of Rome where Augustus made his home. The plural <em>Palātia</em> may here indicate "Palatine areas."</p>
            
            <p>l. 64: <b>scēna</b>. The <b>SBJ</b> of <em>fuit</em>. <em>sine arte</em> is dependent on <em>scēna</em> and functions as <b>ATR</b>. </p>
            
            <p>l. 65: <b>dē</b>. Here with its occasional meaning "from." </p>
            
            <p>l. 66: <b>Quālibet. FEM SING ABL</b> of <em>quī-lĭbet (-lŭbet), quae-libet, quod-libet.</em> This strange compound adjective is made from the relative adjective <em>quī</em> etc. 
                and the verb <em>libet</em> "be pleasing." It has the force of an emphatic indefinate.
                It means something like "whoever / whichever you like."
            </p>
            
            <p>l. 67: <b>quisque</b>. A <b>SING NOM </b>although the parent verb notant is <b>PLUR</b>. It is best to interpret as a secondary predication rather than <b>SBJ</b>. Interpret something like "They, each one, designate ..." </p>
            
            <p>l. 68: <b>movent</b>. This verb often is used to indicate the presence of emotions. Thus, "they stir up many [emotions]" or, more colloquially, "they rile themselves up."</p>
            
            <p>l. 69:<b> Tuscō.</b> From <b>Tuscus, Tusca, Tuscum,</b> "Tuscan" or "Etruscan." Tuscany is a region of Italy north of Rome.</p>
            
            <p>l. 71: <b>mediō</b>. <em>Medius</em> can be used in two ways. It can indicate that its head noun is in the middle of something else or it can indicate the middle part of the head noun. 
                This second use is called the partitive use of the adjective.  </p>
            
            <p>l. 71: <b>plausus</b>. Ovid may be referring a practice of his own time, when groups were hired to applaud at the theaters and law courts. Such a group is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claque">claque</a>.</p>
            
            <p>l. 74: <b>iniciunt</b>. This verb means to "put/throw X upon Y" where X is <b>ACC</b> and Y is <b>DAT</b>.</p>
            
            <p>l. 76: <b>invīsōs</b>.  The adjective <em>invīsus, -a, -um</em> can mean "hostile" or "hated."</p>
            
            <p>l. 83: <b>raptae</b>. Take as secondary predication and translate "the girls are led abducted." </p>
            
            <p>l. 84: <b>decēre</b>. <em>decet</em> can mean "to make X appear attractive, where X is ACC." Ovid is indeed saying that the signs of fear the women were sowing made them more attractive
                to the Romans.</p>
            
            <p>l. 85: <b>qua. FEM SING NOM</b> meaning "any." This form of the adjective occurs after <em>si.</em></p>
            
            <p>l. 85: <b>repugnārat.</b> This is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syncopation#:~:text=syncopation%20(usually%20uncountable,%20plural%20syncopations)%20(linguistics,%20phonology)%20The,and%20weak%20beats%20in%20a%20meter.%20Derived%20terms">syncopated</a> 
                form of the <b>PLUPERF</b> <em>repugnāverat</em>.</p>
            
            <p>l. 86: <b>Sublātam</b>. PPP (<b>PERFECT PASS PART</b>) of <em>tollō, sustulī, sublātus.</em> The <em>puella</em> has been lifted by her kidnapper.</p>
            
            <p>l. 86: <b>sinū</b>. <em>sinus</em> literally means a surface with a bend or fold. Here it refers to the man's arms wrapped around his captive.</p>
            
            <p>l. 87: <b>quid</b>. Here <b>NEU SING ACC</b> used as <b>ADV</b> with meaning "why." The material in quotation marks is dependent (as asn OBJ) on <em>dīxit</em>. </p>
            
            <p>l. 89: <b>scīstī</b>. With an infinitive <b>OBJ</b> rather than an indirect question, this verb means "know how to X" where X is the infinitive. </p>
            
            <p>l. 89: <b>commoda</b>. Here with the meaning "benefits" as in our expression "fringe benefits."</p>
            
            <p>l. 90: <b>sī</b>. As commonly in poetry, <em>sī</em> has been dispaced to the middle of its clause. The subordination indicated by <em>sī</em> in fact begins at the start of the line.</p>
            
            <p>l. 91: <b>Scīlicet</b>. The word is here a sentence adverbial (<b>AuxY</b>) and means something like "obviously," or "evidentially."</p>
            
            <p>l. 91: <b>ex illō.</b> Editors suggest that the phrase is short for <em>ex illō tempore</em> and means "from that time on."</p>
            
            <h3>Ovid turns his attention from the thaeater to the racetrack.</h3>
            
            <p>l. 93: <b>fugiat</b>. What is the most common meaning for a <b>PRES SUBJ</b> verb in a main clause?</p>
            
            <p>l. 94: <b>capāx. MASC SING NOM</b> adjective meaning "able to hold a large quantity." The information, "a large quantity of what?" is often specified by a dependent <b>GEN</b>. In this use, the <b>GEN</b> is considered <b>ADV</b> because it
                limits or clarifies the meaning of an adjective.</p>
            
            <p>l. 95: <b>Nīl</b>.   A <b>NEU SING ACC</b> noun. The ACC is often adverbial meaning something like "to no extent" or "not at all."</p>
            
            <p>l. 95: <b>opus est.</b>  This is probably best taken as a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb">"light verb" phrase</a>. In such expressions, usually composed of a verb and a noun, the inherent meaning
                of the verb loses its importance, and the verb serves primarily to add grammatical information such as tense. An English example is "he took a nap" for "he
                napped." The phrase <em>opus est </em>means "there is need for X" where X is <b>ABL</b>. </p>
            
            <p>l. 97: <b>Proximus</b>. A secondary predication with <em>sedētō.</em></p>
            
            <p>l. 99: <b>bene</b>: Short for <em>bene est,</em> "It is well." </p>
            
            <p>l. 99: <b>quod</b>. A subordinating conjunction 
                introducing a <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0001%3Apart%3D2%3Asection%3D11%3Asubsection%3D4%3Asmythp%3D572">substantive "that clause</a>."</p>
            
            <p>l. 100: <b>Quod</b>. Another substantive clause coordinated with the <em>quod</em>-clause in the previous line.</p>
            
            <p>l. 102: <b>pūblica</b>. <em>pūblica verba</em> are "public words" in the sense of conversations that anyone could listen to without scandal.</p>
            
            <p>l. 103: <b>veniant</b>. What kind of <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0001%3Asmythp%3D574">clause:</a> Qu- word, 
                <b>SUBJ</b> verb, dependant of verb meaning "ask"?</p>
            
            <p>l. 103: <b>requīrās</b>. Dependant on <em>facio</em> we often find a <b>SBJ</b> (with or wihout <em>ut)</em> in a construction sometimes called 
                a <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0001%3Asmythp%3D568">Substantive Clause of Result.</a> 
                In such passages, <em>facio</em> means "ensure/accompish X" where X is the substantive clause.</p>
            
            <p>l. 104: <b>mora</b>. Short for <em>mora sit</em>. What is the most likely meaning for a <b>PRES SUBJ</b> in a main clause?</p>
            
            <p>l. 104: <b>erit</b>. The verb of a headless relative clause that serves as the <b>OBJ</b> of <em>favē</em>.</p>
            
            <p>l. 105: <b>eburnīs</b>. The adjective <em>frequēns</em> is sometimes further specified with a dependent <b>ABL</b>, in the sense of "crowded with X" 
                where X is <b>ABL</b>. The reference is to a pre-race procession, in which statues of the gods were carried through the arena.</p>
            
            <p>l. 107: <b>sī</b>. As happens in poetry, this subordinating conjunction has been delayed to the middle of the clause.</p>
            
            <p>l. 110: <b>Quaelibet</b>. An adjective in the <b>FEM SING NOM</b>, meaning "any at all."</p>
            
            <p>l. 110: <b>officiō</b>. The relevant definition here is "A voluntary service, a kindness, favor, courtesy, rendered to one whose claim to it is recognized."
                Note that <em>officium</em> can be contrasted with <em>beneficium</em>, "a service rendered where there is no claim." Thus, the use of <em>officium</em> implies that the man here does
                a "service" for the woman with the added nuance that the woman deserves to be served in this way.</p>
            
            <p>l. 111: <b>dēmissa</b>. The word often means "low," or "low-hanging" when apples to clothing, etc. </p>
            
            <p>l. 113. <b>pretium</b>. Here means "reward."</p>
            
            <p>l. 114: <b>crūra videnda.</b> A strange and rare use of the participle, called the "dominant participle construction." Simply put, the words do not have 
                the expected meaning of Noun + Attribute ("shins to be seen") but rather something like "the seeing of [her] shins," or "seeing [her] shins."  </p>
            
            <p>l. 115: <b>sedēbit</b>. The verb of a headless relative clause. The clause is here best taken as the <b>SBJ</b> of <emph>premat</emph>. </p>
            
            <p>l. 118: <b>composuisse</b>. An infinitive can be the SBJ of tenses of <emph>est</emph>.</p>
            
            <p>l. 119: <b>Prōfuit</b>. This verb, meaning "be advantageous," often has an infinitive clause as its <b>SBJ</b>: "X is advantageous" where X is an infinitive and dependents. 
                We can translate "it was advantageous to ..."</p>
            
            <p>l. 119: <b>ventōs</b>. Here can be translated "breezes."</p>
            
            <p>l. 119: <b>tabellā</b>. A "little board" is a tablet, here perhaps used to keep track of teams, wagers, etc.</p>
            
            <p>l. 122: <b>harēna</b>. "Sand" refers to the gladiatorial contests, sometimes held in the forum.</p>
            
            <p>l. 123: <b>puer</b>. Who is the child of venus?</p>
            
            <p>l. 124: <b>spectāvit</b>. The verb of a headless relative clause functioning the subject of <em>habet</em>.</p>
            
            <p>l. 125: <b>libellum</b>. The "program" for the contest.</p>
            
            <p>l. 126: <b>pignore</b>. A "wager." <b>SBJ</b> of the ablative absolute clause.</p>
            
            <p>l. 126: <b>vincat</b>. What kind of clause (question word, subjunctive verb, and <em>quaerit</em> as matrix verb)?</p>
            
            <p>l. 127: <b>Saucius</b>. A secondary predication specifying circumstances applying to <em>ingemuit</em>.</p>
