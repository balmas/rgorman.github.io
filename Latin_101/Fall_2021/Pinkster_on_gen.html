      <div class="a"><h2><i>The Oxford Latin Syntax</i> on the Genitive</h2>
        <p>Latin grammars usually distinguish a fairly large number of uses of the genitive as
            marker of attributes; <b>in practice, however, these are characterizations of the
                semantic relationship between the head and the attribute and thus have nothing to do
                with the genitive as such</b>....</p>
        <p> For most combinations of head nouns and attributive Noun Phrases <b>the precise semantic
                function of the genitive attribute is wholly dependent on the meanings of the head
                and attribute constituents involved and the way they are related in the
                extralinguistic world. The scope of possible relations is infinite and no
                restrictions seem to apply: </b>we find animate, inanimate, concrete, abstract,
            alienable, and inalienable entities as attributive genitive Noun Phrases.</p></div>
